# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 10th, 2021
**Today's Progress:** Successfully installed 64-bit version of SDL2 for use with Code::Blocks.

**Thoughts:** Initially installed 32-bit ver upon recommendation from LazyFoo tutorial, but that proved to cause several unexplainable errors. Just setting everything up is proving to be a lot more mentally taxing that I enticipated. Looking forward to begin designing and writing the actual code. The key aspect I want to achieve is a scalable design pattern that avoids bad practices. After that I'll try making something fun to play!

### Day 1: January 9th, 2021
**Today's Progress:** Decided to begin this challenge by getting comfortable with C++. Easier said than done, but managed to wrangle Code::Blocks into successfully compiling multiple files into one standalone exe.

**Thoughts:** C++ is a stickler for details. It both want and requires them. The syntax, the linking, the flags, the config files. It all feels very overwhelming in comparison to, say, Python. Also not a fan of how the nature of .cpp and .h files forces me to repeat myself a lot, and potentially make mistakes while doing so.
