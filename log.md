# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9th, 2021
**Today's Progress:** Decided to begin this challenge by getting comfortable with C++. Easier said than done, but managed to wrangl Code::Blocks into successfully compiling multiple files into one standalone exe.

**Thoughts:** C++ is a stickler for details. It both want and requires them. The syntax, the linking, the flags, the config files. It all feels very overwhelming in comparison to, say, Python. Also not a fan of how the nature of .cpp and .h files forces me to repeat myself a lot, and potentially make mistakes while doing so.
