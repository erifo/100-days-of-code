# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: January 12th, 2021
**Today's Progress:** Continued with the [Emblem Clone](https://github.com/erifo/emblem-clone). Implemented grid movement for the player and collision detection for walls and impassable terrain. Also some crude sprite import and rendering for the player.

**Thoughts:** Prototyping is so much quicker with Python. I feel like my ideas get from thought to working code quick enough that I may as well not be typing at all. Was really tired when I wrote the sprite usage, so gotta clean that up before I continue.

### Day 3: January 11th, 2021
**Today's Progress:** Completely stuck on how to make my exe run independently from Code::Blocks. Static linking causes 50+ build errors of "undefined reference to ___________". Searching for others with similar past issues has not helped, and I am mentally tired of not being able to just write some code already. Scrapped the idea of C++ and instead worked on separating my old [Maze Constructor](https://github.com/erifo/maze-constructor) into logic and graphics. Also begun writing a pygame clone of [Fire Emblem](https://github.com/erifo/emblem-clone)!

**Thoughts:** Switching to Python felt like a breath of fresh air after the last two days. Tinkering with game logic is a billion times more exciting than solving linking errors. At least it raised my resilience against irritation.

### Day 2: January 10th, 2021
**Today's Progress:** Successfully installed 64-bit version of SDL2 for use with Code::Blocks.

**Thoughts:** Initially installed 32-bit ver upon recommendation from LazyFoo tutorial, but that proved to cause several unexplainable errors. Just setting everything up is proving to be a lot more mentally taxing that I enticipated. Looking forward to begin designing and writing the actual code. The key aspect I want to achieve is a scalable design pattern that avoids bad practices. After that I'll try making something fun to play!

### Day 1: January 9th, 2021
**Today's Progress:** Decided to begin this challenge by getting comfortable with C++. Easier said than done, but managed to wrangle Code::Blocks into successfully compiling multiple files into one standalone exe.

**Thoughts:** C++ is a stickler for details. It both want and requires them. The syntax, the linking, the flags, the config files. It all feels very overwhelming in comparison to, say, Python. Also not a fan of how the nature of .cpp and .h files forces me to repeat myself a lot, and potentially make mistakes while doing so.
